## Academic Trajectory
I was born in Brasília, Brazil's capital city, and moved to Campinas, São Paulo by 2011 to study Electrical Engineering at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/?language=en) of [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english). 

After achieving my B.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering by December 2016, I started a Masters in Demography at the [Department of Demography](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/en/pos/demografia/institutional) of the [Institute of Phylosophy and the Humanities](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/) of [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english). I defended my M.Sc thesis on [Fertility and Educational Pairings in Brazil](http://repositorio.unicamp.br/jspui/handle/REPOSIP/333826) in February 2019.

## Professional Career
From October 2018 until June 2020 I worked as a Demography and Statistical Methods Researcher at the [International Policy Centre for the Inclusive Growth](https://ipcig.org/). 

By August 2020, I started working as a Consultant at [CELADE, Population Division](https://www.cepal.org/en/acerca-de-poblacion-y-desarrollo) of the [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC/CEPAL)](https://www.cepal.org/en).

Most of my codes (mostly R, but also a bit of Python) and work are publicly available at my [GitHub](https://github.com/josehcms) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/zecosta.monteiro) pages.

### Other interests and passions 
I am a [Cerrado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado) (aka, the Brazilian Savanna) enthusiast. I strongly recommend you to visit the National Parks located in the State of Goiás and in Brasília and also to experiment the [baru nut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baru_seed) and [pequi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryocar_brasiliense).

I cannot deny I am also a football (soccer?) fan. I am a [Vasco da Gama](https://vasco.com.br/site/) supporter and despite its total incapacity to win titles over the last 20 years, it has one of the most beaultiful histories of football.
