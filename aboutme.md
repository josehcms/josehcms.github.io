subtitle: Some details on my personal life
---

I was born in Brasília, Brazil's capital city, and moved to Campinas, São Paulo by 2011 to study Electrical Engineering at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/?language=en) of [UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english). 

After an amazing experience as an exchange student at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) in Australia, I decided to pursuit a career within the applied social sciences. Then, after graduating in Electrical Engineering by the end of 2016, I started a Masters in Demography at the [Department of Demography](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/en/pos/demografia/institutional) of the [Institute of Phylosophy and the Humanities](https://www.ifch.unicamp.br/ifch/) of UNICAMP.

By the end of my MSc in Demography, October 2018, I started working as a Research Assitant at the [International Policy Centre for the Inclusive Growth](https://ipcig.org/) and came back to Brasília.

### some more

I enjoy hikking and traveling to national parks. Particularly, I love the [Cerrado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerrado) (aka, the Brazilian Savanna) and all of its features, its animals, trees and delicious fruits (everyone should try [baru nut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baru_seed) and [pequi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryocar_brasiliense) at least once in a lifetime!).

I am also a football fan and I try to play it every single week. I am a [Vasco da Gama](https://vasco.com.br/site/) supporter (the team with the most beaultiful history of football!) and a fan of South American football in general.
