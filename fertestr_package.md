[Everton Lima](https://twitter.com/notreve81) and I are developing [fertestr](https://github.com/josehcms/fertestr), a R package with several tools and functions for indirect fertility estimation and parity assessment.

We are basically loading [Tools for Demographic Estimation](http://demographicestimation.iussp.org/) methods into R.

Feel free to use and test it! Suggestions and critics are welcome!
